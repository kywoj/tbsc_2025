Once a drug candidate passes preclinical testing and an IND is accepted, 
it can be tested in people. This stage is known as the **clinical trials phase**.

Clinical trials are conducted in three main stages, each larger and more demanding 
than the one before.

### Phases of Clinical Trials
**Phase 1 (Safety and Dosage)**  
     - Conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers (20–100).  
     - Main goal: assess safety, tolerability, and determine the right dosage range.

**Phase 2 (Efficacy and Side Effects)**  
     - Involves several hundred patients who actually have the disease.  
     - Main goal: test whether the drug works as intended and monitor short-term side effects.

**Phase 3 (Confirmation and Comparison)**  
     - Large, often global trials with thousands of patients.  
     - Main goal: confirm effectiveness, collect more safety data, and compare the drug to standard treatments or placebos.

### Key Principles
- **Randomization** – Patients are randomly assigned to different groups 
(drug, placebo, comparator) to reduce bias.
- **Blinding** – In many trials, patients and/or doctors don’t know who is receiving the drug 
to ensure objective results.
- **Endpoints** – Each trial defines measurable outcomes (e.g., reduced symptoms, improved survival).

> Clinical trials are long, expensive, and risky. 
> Most drug candidates fail during this stage, but those that succeed provide the strongest 
> evidence that a drug can truly benefit patients.
