Congratulations on completing the mini-course! You’ve now explored the full journey of how medicines are discovered, tested, and approved:

1. **Drug Discovery** – Identifying and optimizing potential drug candidates.  
2. **Preclinical Development** – Testing in the lab and in animals to gather safety data.  
3. **Clinical Development** – Running human trials across Phases 1, 2, and 3.  
4. **Regulatory & Commercialization** – Submitting data for approval by agencies like the FDA or EMA.  
5. **Post-Marketing Surveillance** – Monitoring real-world use, safety, and effectiveness.  

Each step is essential to ensure that new treatments are **safe, effective, and trustworthy**.
