This guide provides a clear overview of how new medicines are discovered, tested, and brought to patients.  
            
With this information, designers will be able to translate the complex steps of drug development into intuitive, user-friendly experiences and collaborate more effectively with scientists to make medical innovation more accessible, ethical, and patient-centered.

You’ll learn through **five modules**:  
1. **Drug Discovery** – Finding and optimizing promising molecules  
2. **Preclinical Development** – Lab and animal testing to ensure safety  
3. **Clinical Development** – Human testing in Phases 1, 2, and 3  
4. **Regulatory & Commercialization** – Review and approval by agencies like the FDA or EMA  
5. **Post-Marketing Surveillance** – Monitoring safety and effectiveness in the real world  

At the end, you’ll reach a **Summary & Results page**, and you can review a **Glossary** of key terms anytime.  

Let's start! 🐕
